# 🐛 Bug Fixes Summary - June 13, 2025

## 🎯 Overview
This document summarizes all bugs found and fixed in the Blood Management System after the merge from ThanhTaiFE to main branch.

## ✅ Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Redux Dependencies Missing** ❌→✅
**Issue**: Server failed to start due to missing Redux dependencies
```
Failed to resolve import "redux-persist/lib/storage"
Failed to resolve import "@reduxjs/toolkit"
```
**Solution**: Installed missing dependencies
```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit redux-persist react-redux
```
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. **Code Formatting Issues** ❌→✅
**Issue**: Malformed routes in `App.jsx` due to improper spacing/formatting
```jsx
// Before (malformed)
     {
      path: "/login",
      element: <LoginPage />,
    },     {
```
**Solution**: Fixed route formatting for consistent structure
```jsx
// After (clean)
    {
      path: "/login", 
      element: <LoginPage />,
    },
    {
```
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. **Comment Formatting in DonorList** ❌→✅
**Issue**: Comment merged with code causing potential readability issues
```jsx
// Before
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);  // Load donors from localStorage on component mount
```
**Solution**: Separated comment to its own line
```jsx
// After
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

// Load donors from localStorage on component mount
```
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
